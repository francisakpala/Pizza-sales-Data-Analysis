Problem Statement: Pizza Sales Data Analysis
Overview
In the competitive food industry, data-driven decision-making is essential for business success. Understanding sales performance, customer behavior, and product demand can help optimize operations and maximize profitability. This project aims to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualize sales data for a pizza restaurant. By leveraging SQL and Power BI, we will uncover insights that drive business growth and improve decision-making.

Business Problem
The pizza restaurant wants to improve its operations by gaining deeper insights into its sales data. The management team needs to track revenue, order patterns, and customer preferences to make informed decisions about pricing, inventory, and marketing strategies. However, without proper data analysis and visualization, identifying key trends and optimizing performance remains a challenge.

Objectives
To address this problem, the project will focus on the following key objectives:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Analysis:

Total Revenue: Calculate the total earnings from all pizza sales.
Average Order Value (AOV): Determine the average amount spent per order.
Total Pizzas Sold: Compute the total quantity of pizzas sold.
Total Orders: Count the number of orders placed.
Average Pizzas Per Order: Measure the average number of pizzas sold per order.
